# MeteorLite Weather Application (2022) - Learning Project

An ambitious early project that taught me valuable lessons about scope, complexity, and software architecture.

## What I Attempted
- Real-time weather dashboard with custom Qt GUI
- Extensive database design with Sqlite3. Persistent data storage, manipulation, and display.
- Custom graphing module written in QT
- Complex time-series data processing from National Weather Service API
- Geographic auto-detection and multi-day forecasting
- Always-on-top desktop widget design

## What I Learned
This project was **intentionally over-ambitious** for my skill level at the time. The complex time-parsing logic in `extend_hours()` became unwieldy, and the database architecture grew organically without proper planning.

**Key takeaways that shaped my development:**
- Importance of breaking complex problems into smaller pieces
- Value of clean, testable code architecture
- Benefits of proper error handling and logging
- Need for systematic debugging approaches

## Growth Demonstrated
Compare this early attempt with my recent [Distributed Translation Microservice](https://github.com/galaxyholly/scalable-translation-microservice) to see how my approach to architecture, error handling, and code organization has evolved.

**Then:** Monolithic functions, complex nested logic, minimal error handling
**Now:** Modular design, distributed architecture, comprehensive logging

## Technical Ambition
Despite the execution challenges, this project demonstrates:
- Willingness to tackle complex algorithms
- GUI development experience
- API integration and data processing
- Database design and time-series handling
